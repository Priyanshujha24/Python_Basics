What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","\n","Ans. Python is a computer programming language and it is popular beacuse of its rich library and large community support. It is very easy to write code in python comparing to other languages. It was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. It is case-sensative language and indentation is also necessary.\n","\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. An interpreter in python is a program, use to translate code into machine readable format. It reads and executes code line by line.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. keywords are spacial words which have a certain meaning already defined in python. For example: 'if', 'else', 'for', 'while' etc.\n","\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","\n","Ans. No, keywords can't be used as variable names.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Mutability means changeability. this feature allows to modify the value of variables after created.\n","\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans. we can change the value of a list but once a tuple is created its content cannot be changed. only a way that we convert tuple into list and then change the value of the list and convert back to tuple.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. The \"==\" operator is a comparison operator which check if the two values are equal or not. Whereas \"is\" operator is used to check if wto variables pointing to a same memory location. Both returns True or False.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. There are 3 main logical operators 'AND', 'OR', 'NOT'. It is commonly used to work with conditional sentences. AND operator returns true only if both the operands are true. OR operator returns true if any of the operand is true. NOT oprator works with only one operand and returns opposite of the operand, if the operand is true it will return false.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Type casting in Python refers to the process of explicitly change of data type according to the requirements.This is done using built-in function. For example, 'input' method take data as string from user and if we need the data in 'integer' form we will type cast the data or change its type.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","Ans. Implicit type casting means assigning the value of any data type without user intervention. for exapmle : adding one integer to a float value.\n","Explicit type casting is converting a data type into another required type by user intervention with the help of mentioning the keywords.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. Conditional statements in any programming language is like choosing a prefered condition from two given expression according to the written code. It controls the flow of execution by selecting which block of code is to be executing.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","\n","Ans. elif statement works when 'if' statement doesn't meet the expressed condition. It gets executed before else statement.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","Ans. A variable is needed to iterate the both loop, but in while loop we have to declare a variable before while loop. while loop iterate over a satisfied condition, and we give a expression to modify the iterator variable. For loop iterate over a sequence and no expression is needed to midify iterator variable. iterator works like pointer. it carries one element at a time.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans. Creating a program that takes input from a user until the user enters a specific keyword to exit.we don't know how many times the user would enter data before the keyword, so a while loop is more suitable than a for loop."],"metadata":{"id":"qGdm7JXXUf40"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["***PRACTICAL QUESTIONS***"],"metadata":{"id":"PMA0mPG-T_h2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bjsAGnBpULcR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
