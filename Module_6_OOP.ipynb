        "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which are instances of classes. It helps organize code by grouping data and behavior together, making programs more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. Key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",

        "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make it ideal for building robust and maintainable software. It promotes modularity by organizing code into classes and objects, making it easier to manage. Reusability is achieved through inheritance, allowing code to be reused and extended without duplication. Encapsulation protects internal object data by restricting direct access, improving security and reliability. Abstraction hides unnecessary details and presents only essential features, reducing complexity. With polymorphism, the same method can behave differently across different classes, allowing for flexible and scalable code. Overall, OOP improves maintainability, encourages collaboration, and supports clean, well-structured software design.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the same method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it. This is achieved by defining a method in the base class and then overriding it in derived classes. When a method is called on a base class reference pointing to a subclass object, Python automatically invokes the subclass's version of the method. This supports dynamic method resolution and makes code more flexible and extensible, allowing for generalized interfaces and reusable logic across different types of objects that share a common behavior.\n",

        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Method chaining in Python OOP is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement, one after another. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (self) after performing its operation. Method chaining improves code readability and conciseness, especially when configuring or modifying an object through a series of steps. Its commonly used in fluent interfaces, where each method call modifies the object and returns it, allowing for a streamlined, chainable syntax.\n",

        "Q25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. This special method makes objects \"callable,\" meaning you can use parentheses () after an object to invoke the __call__ method. Its useful for implementing objects that behave like functions, enabling cleaner syntax in scenarios such as function wrappers, decorators, or when designing classes that perform repeated actions. By defining __call__, you can encapsulate function-like behavior within a class while maintaining object-oriented structure and state.\n",
